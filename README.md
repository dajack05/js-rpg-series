# JavaScript RPG Game Development Series

## What the heck is this?

My intention is to take this project (along with the rather bulky Steps.md file) and turn it into a multi-part YouTube tutorial series.

Somewhere out there is a kid who (like me) wants to make video games. Hopefully, this can be a good start for them ðŸ™‚

## Progress Report

Currently, it's just being worked on. Once I have something worth showing off, I'll start making thing videos.
